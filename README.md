# Project Setup Guide

## Getting Started

To ensure a smooth development workflow, please follow these steps before coding:

### 1. Navigate into the App Directory
If you have created an additional folder in your file system to store this GitHub project, make sure to `cd` into the app itself before proceeding:
```sh
cd smart-hdb-finder/frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies and match the required versions:
```sh
npm install
```

This step ensures that everyone is working with the same package versions and avoids compatibility issues.

### 3. Start Coding
Once `npm install` completes successfully, you are good to go! Feel free to start coding ðŸš€.

### 4. Follow Commit Message Semantics
To maintain a clean and meaningful commit history, please follow commit message semantics.
